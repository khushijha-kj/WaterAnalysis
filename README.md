# ðŸ’§ Smart Water Reuse Predictor

A Machine Learning-powered system to determine the best reuse application of white water, developed as part of a sustainable water management initiative.

## ðŸŒ± Project Overview

Once gray water is filtered and cleaned, it becomes *white water*. Although not potable, white water can be safely reused in various non-drinking applications such as irrigation, industrial use, and domestic cleaning. But how do we decide its ideal use case?

This project leverages **Machine Learning** to predict the most sustainable way to reuse white water based on its lab-tested parameters.

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

The dataset consists of manually collected water samples that were tested in the lab. Each sample includes parameters such as:

- pH
- Turbidity
- TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)
- BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand)
- COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand)
- Temperature
- and more...

These parameters help in identifying patterns and determining the most suitable use case for a given sample.

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Labeling**  
   Lab-tested white water samples were collected and categorized based on potential reuse applications.

2. **Clustering**  
   We applied **Hierarchical Clustering** to group similar water profiles together, helping us identify natural clusters of use cases.

3. **Supervised Learning**  
   Using the labeled data, we trained a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to predict the reuse category of new water samples.

4. **Model Integration**  
   The trained model was saved and integrated into a web application that accepts new water parameters and returns the predicted reuse application.
